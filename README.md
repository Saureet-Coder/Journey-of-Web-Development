# Journey-of-Web-Development
This would be my Zero to Hero Journey Diary with Codes and exercises 

Here I would track my progress with the topics and code files

Every Day(with dates) would have the following items : -
<ul>
        <li> Code files </li>
       <li> Readme File</li>
       <li> Other neccessary things</li>
</ul>
